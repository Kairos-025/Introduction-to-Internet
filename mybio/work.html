            <h2>Work</h2>
            <p>
                I have worked as a Front-end Software Developer but am currently working as a Back-end Software Developer. At work, it serves as the launch pad for my practical endeavours. In web development, I have taken flight, creating a responsive website that is a testament to my design sensibilities and user-centric approach. This project was not merely an exercise in coding; it was a venture into the art of crafting digital experiences that seamlessly blend form and function.
            <br />
            <br />
                Software development has been another arena where I have tested the waters. Through hands-on experiences, I have contributed to projects that required more than just code â€“ they demanded an understanding of user needs and an appreciation for the delicate balance between functionality and simplicity.
            <br />
            <br />
                Game development, a realm where creativity meets logic, has been a playground for me. Creating a 2D game was not just about pixels and animations; it was a canvas where I painted my ideas into interactive experiences. This venture showcased my ability to merge creativity with technical acumen, resulting in a product that entertained and engaged me.

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                Within Computer Science, my skills extend beyond the theoretical confines of textbooks. At the core of my technical repertoire is proficiency in more than three programming languages, including C, C++, Python and HTML. These languages have become my linguistic tools, enabling me to communicate with computers and bring ideas to life.
            <br />
            <br />
                Communication, a skill often underestimated in the tech world, plays a pivotal role in my approach to problem-solving. My experiences have taught me that articulating ideas clearly and concisely is as crucial as writing flawless lines of code. This skill bridges the gap between complex technical concepts and effective collaboration within diverse teams.
            <br />
            <br />
                Problem-solving is the engine that propels my journey. I've honed my ability to dissect intricate problems, analyze their components, and devise elegant solutions. Whether it is debugging code or unravelling the complexities of algorithms, problem-solving is the compass that guides me through the labyrinth of challenges in Computer Science.

            <h2>Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                In the journey through the world of code, milestones and achievements are markers of progress. Among these accomplishments is the design and implementation of a responsive website. This project culminated my exploration into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating a website that seamlessly adapts to various devices and screen sizes.
            <br />
            <br />
                One of my proudest achievements is the acquisition of proficiency in more than three programming languages. From the structured syntax of Python to the flexibility of JavaScript, each language added a layer of versatility to my coding repertoire. This achievement broadened my technical skills and reinforced the idea that the language of code is vast and diverse.
            <br />
            <br />
                Creating a basic scientific calculator is a testament to my practical application of programming skills. This project delved into algorithms and user interface design, showcasing my ability to transform theoretical concepts into tangible and functional software.
            <br />
            <br />
                The development of a 2D game marked a significant milestone in my journey. Beyond the lines of code and graphical elements, this project represented the fusion of creativity and logic. From concept to execution, the game was a canvas where I expressed my passion for technology and entertainment.
